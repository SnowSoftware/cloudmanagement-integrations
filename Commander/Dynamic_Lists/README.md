Dynamic Lists for Selecting Canadian City based on province. 
*  The Province list should be before the City list. 
*  There is a dependancy on the city script for the output from the province selection
   defined as ```#{service.settings.dynamicList['Province']}```
*  The output must be a json array for Commander to display it properly on request forms. 
 
Requirements:
* Powershell or Python
