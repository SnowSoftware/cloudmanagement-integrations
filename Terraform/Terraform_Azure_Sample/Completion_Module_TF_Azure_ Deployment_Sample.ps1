Description: Script that copies a TF Config from another folder, creates a new Variables.tf and then runs Init/Apply
Requirements: 
-Snow Comamnder 9.0.0 or higher
-Powershell or PWSH 5.1 or greater
-Terraform binary installed on the commander server located at c:\terraform\terraform.exe and linked to Terraform Cloud.
--https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/cloud-login 
- you might need to copy your TerraformCloud token to C:\Users\CommanderService\AppData\Roaming\terraform.d for Commander to be able to connect to TFCloud.
